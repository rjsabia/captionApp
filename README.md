Photo Babbel
=====================

Welcome to Photo Babbel, a web-app designed to test the concept
of using an artificially intelligent deep learning neural net 
to scan and categorize your photos. In its current first iteration 
Photo Babbel is basically a proof of concept that allows any user
a simple interface that they can upload a few photos to and see what 
a computer see's within them.

Why Not just use the those sites to search?
--------------------------------------------

Whether you are looking for your first developer job
or trying to advance your career, the last thing you want
to do is waste time searching through multiple websites.
Bit Target Job Search is all about allowing the user to 
quickly and easily put job postings infront of them in 
on place. Rather than digging through Github Jobs,
the user search puts exactly what they need infront of
them in seconds.

Technical Specs
===============

Bit Target Job Search was built using a multitude of 
Front End Web technologies to included:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- jQuery

The project was consistanlty stored and controlled using 
git and Github repo's. If you would like to see the 
finalized code for this project, please visit the following

Core Technical Specs
--------------------

At it's core Bit Target is a job search that uses API's to 
access job data. At this time the Github Jobs API is being 
accessed through a AJAX and json query. We are working on 
adding the Stack Overflow Jobs RSS feed in the future.



Where will we go from here?
===========================

While we hope you enjoy this web app now, we want
to continue to add value to it, as well as increase 
user functionality. Future plans include:

- adding the Stack Overflow Jobs RSS feed
- intergrating the Glassdoor API with company reviews
- adding more content to the home page
- adding more page links with useful job search data
